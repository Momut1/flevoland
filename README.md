code to setup dedicated dockers and run the processing pipeline

1. make sure the dockerfile is set up properly and running with full access to the machine's GPU (read the dockerfile_readMe.txt for information on how to set this up)

2. if planning on running this on AWS - check out the aws_GPU_instance.txt for detailed instructions on how to properly set the versions of the prerequisite libraries.
